# Portfolio - Zenithrium

This profile serves as a portfolio for my current work in RoR2 modding. Most of these contributions are in the [VanillaVoid repo](https://github.com/Zenithrium/vanillaVoid), or the [Starstorm2 repo](https://github.com/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2). A good bit of work - particularly early on in my time working on Starstorm2 was bug fixing and tweaks, which are not mentioned here.
