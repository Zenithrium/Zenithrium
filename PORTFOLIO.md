# Portfolio - Zenithrium

This profile serves as a portfolio for my current work in RoR2 modding. Most of these contributions are in the [VanillaVoid repo](https://github.com/Zenithrium/vanillaVoid), or the [Starstorm2 repo](https://github.com/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2). A good bit of work - particularly early on in my time working on Starstorm2 was bug fixing and tweaks, which are not mentioned here.

### Engineer Skills
Laser Focus (Primary) and Rapid Displacement (Utility) -
Laser Focus fires two continual lasers that deal more damage the longer a given target is focused on.
Rapid Displacement moves the Engineer forward, stunning and knocking back enemies in the way. Activating it in midair or jumping during the ability causes a burst of upward momentum, which can also deal damage.

### Deadly Voltage
Primary for Starstorm2's Executioner. Chains lightning between enemies. Misses leave a tracer showing range and excess bounces try to hit the ground when lacking enough enemies nearby.
